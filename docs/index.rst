Welcome to dishes's documentation!
=================================

This code can be used to work with interferometric visibilities and images from ALMA and the VLA, and provides a number of utilities such as wrappers for common tools used to Fourier transform model images onto visibility datasets, built in imaging and deconvolution routines, etc. This documentation will be updated soon.

If you have any questions about using the code (or this documentation), requests for features, or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail.
